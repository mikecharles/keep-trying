keep-trying
===========

The `keep-trying` command executes a given command every X minutes, and stops after Y minutes, or when the command succeeds. It's useful for trying to run a command that, for example, uses input data that may or may not be available yet.

This script assumes the command passes or fails based on the exit status of the command, so if you're running your own script as the command, make sure it exits with the proper exit status (0 for success, anything else for failure).

Installing
----------

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mikecharles/keep-trying.git

This will install the `keep-trying` script in `~/bin` (it will create the `~/bin` directory if it doesn't already exist).

    $ keep-trying -s 5 -t 60 ~/bin/myscript.sh
